# reinforcement project for CIS 571 at the University of Oregon

This project is an exploration into reinforcement learning, applied to PAC-MAN. The highlight of the project is an approximate Q-learning agent that can quickly
learn the game and play near optimally. 

This project comes from the Berkley CS188 AI class, and more information can be found [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)

IMPORTANT NOTE: I did not create / code most of the files in this repository. For the project, I edited valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py, and
analysis.py

This was a fun project, and a great introduction to programming q-learning agents in python!
